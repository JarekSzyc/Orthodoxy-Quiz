## About people with homosexual tendencies
"This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with **respect, compassion, and sensitivity**. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided." ~ CCC 2358

## About homosexual acts
"tradition has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered." They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. **Under no circumstances can they be approved.**" ~ CCC 2357

## Prescriptive norm
"Homosexual persons are called to **chastity**. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection." ~ CCC 2359

## CDF stance
"[The Church] is also aware that the view that homosexual activity is equivalent to, or as acceptable as, the sexual expression of conjugal love has a direct impact on society's understanding of the nature and rights of the family and puts them in jeopardy." ~ CDF, point 9., see below.
